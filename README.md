## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The **Smart Watering System for Houseplants** is an IoT solution designed to automate plant care through real-time monitoring and responsive controls. It helps prevent under- and over-watering by using soil moisture and temperature data to intelligently activate a water pump. The project combines Arduino-based sensors, MQTT communication, cloud services (AWS EC2, MongoDB Atlas), and Node-RED to deliver a scalable and user-friendly smart plant care system.
